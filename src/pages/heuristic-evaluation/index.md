## Evaluation for Swap Pal

1. The landing page once signed in is a list of items, but there is no indication what these items are. I assume they are items available for swapping but some label would be nice, as well as indicating if there are any filters on the items (such as where they are located, etc).  
   **Heuristic**: Visibility of system status  
   **Severity**: Minor  

2. Upon hitting the “Post” button when creating a post, it says what is supposed to happen instead of actually happening. I assume that will be fixed in the final implementation, but I also did not see anywhere I could delete a post if I changed my mind about it. If it exists, it should be more clearly marked in my posts.  
   **Heuristic**: User control and freedom  
   **Severity**: Major

3. When trying to log out and log back in to complete the second task, I could not find a logout method anywhere on the application. I had to manually go back to the given URL to log in. There should be a way for the user to log out in the application.  
   **Heuristic**: User control and freedom  
   **Severity**: Major

4. On the login screen, I would expect that pressing the enter key after entering all my credentials would trigger the login button (as this is the behavior in most other websites). However I had to manually click on the Login button.  
   **Heuristic**: Consistency and standards  
   **Severity**: Minor

5. When no results are found in the search bar, the app suggests “Why not create you own post” which has a typo.  
   **Heuristic**: Consistency and standards  
   **Severity**: Cosmetic

6. On the details page for an item, I see that the poster (Anna in this case) has 4 stars out of 5, but there is no other information about any ratings or reviews. I am confused as to why Anna only has 4 stars, and want to see any relevant information such as any reviews or even the number of ratings (so I know if it was just one person who rated 4/5 or it was over several different people).  
   **Heuristic**: Consistency and standards  
   **Severity**: Minor

7. On the details page for an item, I see the Contact button at the bottom of the page, and when I click it, it shows the email but also “Don't forget to ask Anna for the Invitation Code before doing the transaction”. I have no idea what the invitation code is and these instructions make me more confused.  
   **Heuristic**: Help and documentation  
   **Severity**: Major

8. On my profile page, there are several tabs including “Your Post” and “In Transaction”. When comparing the two, I’m not sure of the difference. It seems “Your Post” should be the listings that I have posted, while “In Transaction” is maybe the swaps that are happening? However I am not sure how those listings get to that state, since it seems the “Old desk” posting is not mine yet it is in there.  
   **Heuristic**: Recognition rather than recall  
   **Severity**: Major

9. The Cancel button on the “In Transaction” tab doesn’t do anything when I click it.  
   **Heuristic**: Visibility of system status  
   **Severity**: Major

10. I like the separation of different parts of a user profile into the tabs. It keeps the information on the page minimal, uncluttered, and easily accessible by category.  
   **Heuristic**: Aesthetic and minimalist design  
   **Severity**: Good

11. I like the navigation bar at the top of every page and how it has several action items that you can quickly jump to. However the Search bar is there for every page while it is only relevant on the postings page.  
   **Heuristic**: Flexibility and efficiency of use  
   Aesthetic and minimalist design  
   **Severity**: Good, Cosmetic
